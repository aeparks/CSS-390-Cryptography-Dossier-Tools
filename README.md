# CSS 390 Cryptography Dossier Tools
The Dossier Tools are small programs written for the explicit purpose
of helping to analyze, understand, and dicipher coded assignments
in CSS 390: Cryptogrpahy from the Autumn 2009 quarter at the University
of Washington Bothell.

The original goal was to have an automated way to generate a frequency
analysis, digraph count, and trigraph count among other things.  Other
helpful tools were considered, but not implemented due to the course
ending for the quarter.
