# "Dossier Tools" (Autumn 2009)
The Dossier Tools are small programs written for the explicit purpose
of helping to analyze, understand, and dicipher coded assignments
in CSS 390 Cryptogrpahy course at the University
of Washington Bothell.

The original goal was to have an automated way to generate a frequency
analysis, digraph count, and trigraph count among other things.  Other
helpful tools were considered, but not implemented due to the course
ending for the quarter.
